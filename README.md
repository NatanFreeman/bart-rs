# transformer-rust
In this repo, I attempt to program the transformer from the [2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). I use Rust and huggingface's [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) framework to achieve this. The goal is to fully understand how transformers work by coding one myself.
